# Analyses and figures for updated CADE and PIJE

This will involve analysis of new genotype probability matrices generated with more thorough exploration of filtering space by Seth and Tom. Listed here are figures that are either clearly appropriate for the manuscript, or which are necessary for exploring data.

## Genetic Data:

**CADE:**


**PIJE:**


## Environmental Data:
For the environmental data we will use the climateNA data that Carolina has pulled, summarized and collapsed into 5-6 variables.


## Tables and Figures

### Table S1 
**CADE** Pop ID, lat, long, elevation, He, Ho, env. variables


### Table S2
**PIJE** Pop ID, lat, long, elevation, He, Ho, env. variables


### Figure 1: Geographic Genetic Structure illustrated by PCA

6 panel PCA, top for CADE, bottom for PIJE. From left to right these should be PCA with points colored by population, Fireworks plot of PCA, and PCA with points colored by latitude color ramp.

### Figure 2 (maybe): Isolation By Distance, Isolation By Environment

6 panel, top for CADE, bottom for PIJE. Left to right for each should be Genetic distance by Geographic Distance, Genetic Distance by Environmental Distance, and Environmental Distance by Geographic Distance.

### Figure 3: Phylogenetic patterns with drop tip onto maps
2 panels, CADE then PIJE


### Figure 4. Genetic Environment Associations
RDA, CADE then PIJE. Perhaps followed by map with most important variable for each across the sierra.

Gradient forest?

### Figure 5. Genomic OFFSET. Two methods?
